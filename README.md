# Russian housing market prediction
The goal of this project is to predict the sale price of Russian houses based on a broad spectrum of features provided by Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/sberbank-russian-housing-market/data). The challenges in this dataset is to clean data and feature engineering because the data exhibits a lot of missing values and several feature variables highly correlated to each other. Through this project, I will show comprehensive data exploration, including: univariate and bi-variate analysis, multicollinearity treatment, missing values treatment in order to maximize insight into data and improve the quality of the input variables. After preprocessing data, a highly sophisticated algorithm - XGBoost regression is used to train and predict house price with satisfying performance. <br />
